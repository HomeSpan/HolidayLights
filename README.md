# HolidayLights - A HomeSpan Project

HolidayLights implements various special lighting effects using a 60-pixel RGBW LED strip, fully controllable from the Home App, with some help from the Eve for HomeKit App, on your iPhone.  Built using the [HomeSpan](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan) HomeKit Library, HolidayLights is designed to run on an ESP32 device as an Arduino sketch.
